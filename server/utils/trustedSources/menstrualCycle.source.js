    "The menstrual cycle is the body’s monthly process that can lead to bleeding (‘a period’).",
    "In the first 1–2 years, cycles can be irregular (not the same number of days each month).",
    "Common signs: cramps, mood changes, bloating, acne, headaches, sore breasts—usually mild to moderate.",
    "Pads, tampons, and menstrual cups are options; choose what feels comfortable and safe for you.",
    "Tracking your period (calendar/app) can help you notice patterns and prepare.",
    "It’s okay to ask questions—talk to a trusted adult, school nurse, or healthcare professional if you’re unsure.",
