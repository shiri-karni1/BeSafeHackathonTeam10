  excerpt: `
School and hobbies play an important role in a teen’s development.
Attending school helps build knowledge, responsibility, and social skills.
Hobbies and extracurricular activities can reduce stress, improve confidence,
and help teens discover interests and talents.

Skipping school or avoiding responsibilities can lead to academic and personal
consequences. When school feels overwhelming, it’s better to talk to a teacher,
counselor, or trusted adult rather than avoiding school.

Skipping school or trying to avoid school rules (for example, “how to skip without getting caught”) is not a healthy solution and can lead to consequences.
If school feels overwhelming, it’s better to talk to a trusted adult (parent, teacher, or counselor) and ask for help.


Balancing schoolwork with hobbies and rest is part of maintaining a healthy routine.
