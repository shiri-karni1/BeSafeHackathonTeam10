  excerpt: `
Sexual coercion is when someone uses pressure or influence to get someone to agree to sexual activity.
Consent must be freely given, without pressure, manipulation, or guilt.
If someone agrees because they feel worn down, threatened, or afraid of consequences, that is not real consent.
Respecting boundaries means accepting “no” (or uncertainty) without trying to change someone’s mind.
Someone is allowed to change their mind at any time.
