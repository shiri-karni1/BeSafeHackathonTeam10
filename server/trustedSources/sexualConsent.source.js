  excerpt: `
Consent means actively agreeing to be sexual with someone.
Both people must agree every single time for it to be consensual.
Consent must be freely given, without pressure or manipulation.
Anyone can change their mind at any time, and consent can be withdrawn.
Silence or past behavior is not consent.
People who are drunk, high, or unconscious cannot give consent.
